prointro: Propose and design a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization">particle swarm optimization</a> algorithm to make full use of the heterogeneous property of scale-free networks and make exploration and exploitation more balance. The project is finished with Nan Jiang, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenbo_Du3">Wenbo Du</a>, <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ketang/">Ke Tang</a> and <a href="https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/info/1057/1229.htm">Xianbin Cao</a>, and it has been published (Early Access) on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8411503">IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering</a>.

### Background

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization">Particle swarm optimization</a> is a widespread optimization algorithm presented by Kennedy and Eberhart dealing with complex practical matters in many fields. In PSO, a flock of particles fly in the searching space during the optimization process and try to find out the optimal solution cooperatively. PSO has attracted many researchers since its appearance, and many variants of PSO have been proposed to better balance exploration and exploitation.

However, in most of the variants, particles can only learn from the neighbors on the static topology structure, which limits the information interaction in the swarm. In this project, we propose a particle swarm optimization with moving particles on scale-free networks (MP-PSO), where particles are consistently restricted in a static scale-free base network but are partly free to adaptively change the swarm network with the moving strategy during iterations.
