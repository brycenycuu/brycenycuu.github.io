mydate: Jun. 2018
prointro: Propose and design a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization">particle swarm optimization</a> algorithm to make full use of the heterogeneous property of scale-free networks and make exploration and exploitation more balance. The project is finished with Nan Jiang, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenbo_Du3">Wenbo Du</a>, <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ketang/">Ke Tang</a> and <a href="https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/info/1057/1229.htm">Xianbin Cao</a>, and it has been published (Early Access) on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8411503">IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering</a>.

### What is PSO?

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization">Particle swarm optimization</a> is a widespread optimization algorithm presented by Kennedy and Eberhart.

In PSO, a flock of particles fly in the searching space during the optimization process and try to find out the optimal solution cooperatively. PSO has attracted many researchers since its appearance, and many variants of PSO have been proposed to better balance exploration and exploitation.

### What is MP-PSO?

In most of the variants, particles can only learn from the neighbors on the static topology structure, which limits the information interaction in the swarm. In MP-PSO, particles are consistently restricted in a static scale-free base network, but are **partly free to adaptively change the swarm network** with the **moving strategy** during iterations.

The figure below briefly shows how the moving strategy works.

### How MP-PSO performs?

In experiments, MP-PSO is compared with other 5 PSO variants on 16 unimoadal and (rotated) multimodal benchmark functions. MP-PSO can obtain best results on 6 of 11 multimodal and rotated multimodal problems (including 3 multimodal functions and 3 rotated multimodal functions), remarkably outperforming other algorithms. Experiments on other aspects also show its outstanding performance.
