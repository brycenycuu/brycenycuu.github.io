title: Particle Swarm Optimization with Moving Particles on Scale-Free Networks
mydate: Dec. 2018
prointro: Proposed and designed a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization">PSO</a> algorithm to make full use of the heterogeneous property of scale-free networks and make exploration and exploitation more balance. The project has been published (Early Access) on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8411503">IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering</a>.
