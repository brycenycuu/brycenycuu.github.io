title: Particle Swarm Optimization with Moving Particles on Scale-Free Networks
mydate: Dec. 2018
prointro: Propose and design a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization">particle swarm optimization</a> algorithm to make full use of the heterogeneous property of scale-free networks and make exploration and exploitation more balance. The project is finished with Nan Jiang, <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ketang/">Ke Tang</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenbo_Du3">Wenbo Du</a> and <a href="https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/info/1057/1229.htm">Xianbin Cao</a>, and it has been published (Early Access) on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8411503">IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering</a>.
