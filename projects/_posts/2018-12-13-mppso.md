prointro: Propose and design a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization">particle swarm optimization</a> algorithm to make full use of the heterogeneous property of scale-free networks and make exploration and exploitation more balance. The project is finished with Nan Jiang, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenbo_Du3">Wenbo Du</a>, <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ketang/">Ke Tang</a> and <a href="https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/info/1057/1229.htm">Xianbin Cao</a>, and it has been published (Early Access) on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8411503">IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering</a>.

### What is PSO?

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization">Particle swarm optimization</a>, presented by Kennedy and Eberhart, is a widespread optimization algorithm dealing with complex practical matters in many fields.

In PSO, a flock of particles fly in the searching space during the optimization process and try to find out the optimal solution cooperatively. Each particle has its certain position in the space, which is evaluated by fitness value. During iterations, the velocity and position of a particle are updated according to the best position discovered before by both itself and other interacted particles. PSO has attracted many researchers since its appearance, and many variants of PSO have been proposed to better balance exploration and exploitation.

### What is MP-PSO?

In most of the variants, particles are with fixed interaction patterns during the optimization process. Particles can only learn from the neighbors on the static topology structure, which limits the information interaction in the swarm.

In MP-PSO, particles are consistently restricted in a static scale-free base network, but are **partly free to adaptively change the swarm network** with the **moving strategy** during iterations. The base network is a sratic scale-free network, and the swarm network is the network consists of particles and edges between them.

The figure below briefly shows how the moving strategy works.

		Red points are particles and bold edges are edges in the swarm network. The particle changes its topology position based on the base network, according to the arrow. While the base network is static, the information source of interaction changes after this iteration.

### How MP-PSO performs?

In experiments, MP-PSO is compared with other 5 PSO variants on 16 unimoadal and (rotated) multimodal benchmark functions. MP-PSO can obtain best results on 6 of 11 multimodal and rotated multimodal problems (including 3 multimodal functions and 3 rotated multimodal functions), remarkably outperforming other algorithms. 

Experiments on other aspects, including convergence speed and success rate, also show its outstanding performance.
