mydate: Dec. 2018
prointro: and designing a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization">PSO</a> algorithm to make full use of the heterogeneous property of scale-free networks and make exploration and exploitation more balance. The project has been published on IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering with <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8411503">doi: 10.1109/TNSE.2018.2854884</a>.
