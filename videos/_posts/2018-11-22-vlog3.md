Seems the first time to watch a parade on the spot.

Though it was really cold, excited to see such huge balloons.

Many people cheered along the road all the time which makes me realizeâ€‹ that maybe this is the mean of festivals and Thanksgiving Day Parade.

On this day we all go back to childhood...
